    "## 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains the SPARC-P agent on HiPerGator using **conda environments** (per UF RC requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, create the conda environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /blue/jasondeanarnold/SPARCP\n",
    "module load conda\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create environment (first time only)\n",
    "conda env create -f environment_training.yml -p /blue/jasondeanarnold/SPARCP/conda_envs/sparc_training\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate environment\n",
    "# conda activate /blue/jasondeanarnold/SPARCP/conda_envs/sparc_training\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Python 3.11 is required for compatibility with CUDA 12.8 and PyTorch 2.1+.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Architectural Philosophy \n",
    "This system uses a hybrid approach:\n",
    "- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Provides real-time, factually accurate knowledge from the `/blue` storage tier.\n",
    "- **PEFT/QLoRA**: Adapts the **gpt-oss-120b** base model to specific personas using 4-bit quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Target Environment\n",
    "- **System**: HiPerGator AI SuperPOD (NVIDIA A100/B200)\n",
    "- **Package Manager**: Conda (mandatory per UF RC)\n",
    "- **Storage**: `/blue` tier (Home directory is strictly limited)"

    "- Prints the exact Python interpreter path and version so you can confirm you're in the correct `sparc_training` conda environment (not a system Python).\n",
    "- Runs a `try/except` block that imports `torch`, checks GPU availability (`torch.cuda.is_available()`), and reports the PyTorch version. If any package is missing, instead of crashing silently it prints **exactly which conda commands to run** to create and activate the correct environment.\n",

It then replaces each detected entity with its type tag (e.g., a patient's name becomes `<PERSON>`). The original text is **never returned** if sanitization fails.\n",
    "- **Retry logic**: If sanitization fails (network issue, parser error), it retries up to 3 times with increasing wait times before giving up.\n",
    "- **Quarantine list**: Documents that fail sanitization after all retries are logged to `SANITIZATION_QUARANTINE` with the reason for failure — they are NOT passed to training. This ensures no PHI can leak into the AI models even if sanitization fails.\n",

The SFTTrainer updates only these adapters based on the synthetic dataset, resulting in a lightweight, portable model file.\n"

    "This is the core fine-tuning function — `run_qlora_training()` — that takes a training data file and an output directory, then trains the large language model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). This is the most technically sophisticated cell in the notebook, so here is a plain-English walkthrough of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **4-bit quantization (`BitsAndBytesConfig`)**: The large base model (`gpt-oss-120b`) is too big to fit in GPU memory at full precision. Quantizing to 4-bit using the NF4 format compresses it by ~8×, making it trainable on a single A100 GPU. Computation still happens in BFloat16 for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load base model + tokenizer**: Downloads the 120B parameter model from HuggingFace (requires valid credentials), maps it automatically across available GPUs, and loads the tokenizer. The `pad_token` is set to `eos_token` if not already defined (required for batch processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LoRA configuration**: Instead of updating all 120B parameters (which would be extremely expensive), only small \"adapter\" matrices are trained. `r=16` means each adapter is a 16-rank matrix — tiny compared to the full model but sufficient to teach the model new behavior patterns. Adapters are attached to all four attention projection layers (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load dataset**: Reads the JSONL training file into a HuggingFace Dataset object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chat template rendering (`format_chat`)**: Converts the `messages` list-of-dicts format into a single string the tokenizer can process. Uses the model's built-in chat template if available, otherwise falls back to a simple role:content format. This explicit rendering step is critical — passing raw message lists to SFTTrainer directly causes training errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pre-training validation**: Renders the first 2 samples and confirms they are non-empty strings before the trainer is even created. Catches data formatting errors early.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Training arguments**: Batch size 1 per GPU (the model is large), gradient accumulation over 4 steps (effective batch = 4), learning rate 2e-4, up to 500 steps, saving every 50 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **SFTTrainer**: The Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer from the `trl` library. `packing=False` is a safety setting — it forces each conversation to occupy its own context window rather than packing multiple examples together, which can cause data corruption at example boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** `trainer.train()` is commented out. To actually train, uncomment it, or use the SLURM script generator (Section 7.1) to run it in batch mode on HiPerGator with `RUN_TRAINING=true`."

    "- **`RUN_TRAINING=true` is set**: Confirms the env var that unlocks training is exported in the script. Without this, the notebook would run in dry-run mode and produce no trained model.\n",

If safe, it produces a routing decision JSON like `{\"recipient\": \"CaregiverAgent\", \"payload\": \"...\"}`.\n",

    "4. **Worker agent response**: The selected worker agent (Caregiver or Coach) generates a response JSON in its own format — emotional/gesture tags for Caregiver, structured rubric feedback for Coach.\n",
